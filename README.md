# Ivan Divilkovskiy – Data & Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of projects in international development, data analysis, and spatial visualization. I combine practical experience in project management and research with technical skills in Python, Stata, QGIS, and GPT-driven automation.

Each folder contains a project where I applied data science and policy analysis techniques to development-related challenges.

## 🌍 Projects

### 1. [UN Peacekeeping Fatalities Visualization](./Peacekeeping_Fatalities)
An animated geospatial visualization of UN peacekeeping missions and fatalities over time. Combines GPT-assisted data enrichment, Python-based processing and QGIS visualisation.
