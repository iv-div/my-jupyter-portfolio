    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The United Nations peacekeeping mandate comes from the United Nations Charter, chapters VI and VII. Since its establishment, the UN has deployed peacekeepers around the world to monitor and support ceasefires, creating a path to sustainable peace. Sadly, peacekeepers serving in these missions lose their lives to malicious acts, accidents, illnesses, and self-inflicted causes. These deaths are registered in a publicly-accessible dataset that gives us an opportunity to have a data-informed overview of the UN peacekeeping missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Situation & Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a [dataset listing all registered deaths of UN peacekeepers](https://psdata.un.org/dataset/DPPADPOSS-FATALITIES). We want to quickly visualise the information from this dataset using QGIS to create an animation that would explain the changing geography and intensity of the missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scope & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will map all UN peacekeeping missions that have had at least 1 fatality on the world map. We will be using the present borders of the countries. A country will be the smallest unit in our mapping since we wonâ€™t be able to pinpoint the location of the UN missions to sub-national geographical units. We will be using AI-assisted Python, AI-based data preprocessing, and QGIS."
